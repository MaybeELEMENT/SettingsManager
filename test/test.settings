$This is a comment
test = Hello World! 
test_comment_at_value = Hey! $Comment must own a line, or else it will be a part of value
compile_enabled       = true
hello                 =  123
weller man = Space at name will be ignored, so to get the value of the 'weller man', you have to use 'wellerman' instead of 'weller man'.
$            If you want to use something to represent space, recommended to use _ instead. Any Symbol and alphabet for name is acceptable except equal and space

$Any Symbol and alphabet is accept for value, value of 'happy_coding' will be '= Hi'
happy_coding = = Hi
